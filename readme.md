# GDS Prototype kit: Map component test

## Work in progress

A demo prototype to trial using a map component.

This repo contains examples of local npm packaged components.

To run this, follow the guide to install the test [map component](https://github.com/mcoulthurst/hmlr-simple-map) locally.

Remove `hmlr-custom-button`,  `hmlr-static-map-image` from the package.json. Delete the `static-map.html` page.
